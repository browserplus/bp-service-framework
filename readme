This project provides a header-only framework for easy authoring of BrowserPlus
services in C++.

A very simple demonstration service using this framework may be found at:
http://github.com/dgrigsby/bp-helloworld.

A more complex service based on this framework may be found at:
http://github.com/browserplus/bp-pubsub.


To use this framework:

1) Either download the files or setup bp-service-framework as a git
submodule of your project.  The projects listed above demonstrate the git
submodule approach.

2) Create a class for your service and derive it from
bplus::service::Service.

3) Add an invokation of: BP_SERVICE( YourClasName ) in your class declaration.

4) Use BP_SERVICE_DESC, ADD_BP_METHOD, ADD_BP_METHOD_ARG, and
END_BP_SERVICE_DESC macro to setup the C API of your service.

5) Use Service::context() and Service::log() as needed.

6) Use bplus::service::Transaction and bplus::service::Callback as needed.

7) Use utility classes and functions from the bputil directory as needed.
