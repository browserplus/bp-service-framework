BrowserPlus Service Framework

This project provides a header-only framework for easy authoring of BrowserPlus
services in C++.

A very simple demonstration service using this framework may be found at:
http://github.com/dgrigsby/bp-helloworld.

A more complex service based on this framework may be found at:
http://github.com/browserplus/bp-pubsub.


To use this framework:

1) Either download the files or setup bp-service-framework as a git
submodule of your project.  The projects listed above demonstrate the git
submodule approach.

2) Create a class for your service and derive it from
bplus::service::Service.

3) Add an invokation of: BP_SERVICE( YourClassName ) in your class declaration.

4) Use BP_SERVICE_DESC, ADD_BP_METHOD, ADD_BP_METHOD_ARG, and
END_BP_SERVICE_DESC macro to setup the C API of your service.

5) Use Service::context() and Service::log() as needed.

6) Use bplus::service::Transaction and bplus::service::Callback as needed.

7) Use utility classes and functions from the bputil directory as needed.

8) If you use CMake to build your service, you may find it convenient for
your CMakeLists.txt to include build_support/BuildConfigs.cmake to setup
some default compiler/linker settings.
