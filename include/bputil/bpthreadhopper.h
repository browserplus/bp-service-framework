 *
 * This class is focues on the use case of wanting to hop through
 * the message pump to invoke a callback after function return.  By 
 * making the gaurantee that all callbacks will be invoked after
 * function completion, clients of derived classes will have more
 * predictable usage semantics and hopefully have to write less code.
 *
 * Finally, the alternate implementation tactics would be to design
 * functions which return synchronously or asynchronously, or invoke
 * client callbacks before invoked functions return.  The former
 * requires clients to create additional functions to capture
 * commonality and the latter is often unintuitive.
